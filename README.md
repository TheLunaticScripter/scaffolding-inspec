# scaffolding-inspec

`scaffolding-inspec` is a Chef Habitat scaffolding for implementing the Effortless pattern for Chef InSpec.

You can implement the Effortless pattern for Chef InSpec by building a Habitat package and using this scaffolding. All you need to do is make a Habitat plan (`plan.sh` or `plan.ps1`). Additionally, you can tune the settings of the InSpec client in your `default.toml`
